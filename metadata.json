    "Title": "Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay (PAMPA) 7",
    "Description": "Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability is an in vitro surrogate to determine the permeability of drugs across cellular membranes. PAMPA at pH 7.4 was experimentally determined in a dataset of 5,473 unique compounds by the NIH-NCATS. 50% of the dataset was used to train a classifier (SVM) to predict the permeability of new compounds, and validated on the remaining 50% of the data, rendering an AUC = 0.88. The Peff was converted to logarithmic, log Peff value lower than 2.0 were considered to have low to moderate permeability, and those with a value higher than 2.5 were considered as high-permeability compounds. Compounds with a value between 2.0 and 2.5 were omitted from the dataset. A subset of the data is available at PubChem (AID 1645871)",
